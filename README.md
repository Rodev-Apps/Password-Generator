# Password-Generator
_An app to generate strong secure passwords._

## Overview
In this project, I have create an application that a staff/employee can use to generate secure passwords based on the criteria they select from the prompts that they receive. This app is designed to run on any browser, and dynamically updated the HTML contents and CSS parameters powered by JavaScript to randomly generate passwords. 

## Description
The “Password Generator” App takes an input from the user and generates a result. It features a user interface that is clean, polished and responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes and provides a pleasurable user experience. 

## Usage
This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and the expected result derived from it. The contents therein comprise only that related to the project and I have kept the interface very simple and straight forward to use. Simply click on the button to start, follow the prompts, and refresh the page to start over; it’s that easy. Click [**here.**](https://rodev-apps.github.io/Password-Generator/)
 to begin.
